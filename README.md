# Clocks

These are various Arduino-compatible clock devices that I have built using my
AceTime library (https://github.com/bxparks/AceTime).

* [CommandLineClock](CommandLineClock)
    * A clock that can be accessed through the serial port.
    * Useful for quick debugging.
* [OledClock](OledClock)
    * A clock with a single SSD1306 OLED display, supporting a single timezone.
* [WorldClock](OledClock)
    * A clock with 3 SSD1306 OLED displays, supporting 3 concurrent timezones.
